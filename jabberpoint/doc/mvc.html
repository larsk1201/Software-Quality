<h1>JabberPoint(tm): Implementing MVC in Java</h1>
<p>MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a 
<a href="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dbutler/tutorials/winter96/patterns/">design pattern</a>
that provides a useful separation of functionality and has been shown to produce
effective GUI designs and to promote reusability.
<p>This page tries to illustrate some of the issues around MVC
by using as its example JabberPoint(tm), a simple slide-show program
that has no relationship at all to Microsoft(r) PowerPoint(tm).
<b>N.B. This is not the full source code</b>, but only the fragments
needed to show the MVC architecture. If you want the full source
code to compile or use, go to the course author's web site,
<a href="http://www.darwinsys.com/">http://www.darwinsys.com/</a>,
and follow the link to Free Software.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Just to remind you of what we said MVC stands for:</p>
<img src="mvc.gif">
<ul>
<li>The <b>model</b> contains the data and functionality, can be displayed by many views
<br/>Commonly includes a main program
</li>
<br/>May subclass <kbd>java.util.Observable</kbd>
<li>The <B>view</B> is the GUI or display of the model's data
<br/>Commonly creates a frame, or is an applet, and adds listeners
</li>
<br/>May implement <kbd>java.util.Observer</kbd>
<li>The <B>controller</B> handles events for the model and the view
<br/>Commonly implements <kbd>listener</kbd> interfaces and responds to events by calling methods in the model
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following paragraphs we point out some key features of each.</p>
<h2>The Model</h2>
<p>Here is part of the Model,
<a href="JPModel.java">Model.java</a>
</p>
<h2>The View(s)</h2>
<p>The simplest view is a 
<a href="View.java">SlideShow view</a>, which simply paints the current
page in large letters.
This View is a Component that can be imbedded in a Frame or Applet.
</p>
<p>How does it know when to do so? Note the method update().
This is <B>not</B> the update method of AWT, but is part of the
<kbd>Observable</kbd> interface. This update simply saves the data
it was passed in as a Slide, and calls AWT's repaint, which will call
the paint method a few lines below it in the listing.
</p>
<p>But there can be more than one view.
In a slide show program there are usually three: the slideshow (which
we implement), and the Outline and Sorter (which we do not yet
provide). Each of these would be a different view, and would be
registered as an Observer for the Model as above.
You could switch between them using some kind of
Layout manager.
Or, they could each be in a Frame; <I>because they use Observable/Observer,
when you updated the data in one window, it would immediately be
updated in all of them!</I>
</p>
<h2>The Controller(s)</h2>
<p>The controllers are invoked when the user does something.
Here is a nice simple controller, to give you the idea.
The
<a href="KeyController.java">KeyController.java</a>
just responds to PageUp and PageDown (or Enter), and moves
the current page up or down as appropriate.
</p>
<p>It is "connected" with
<code>
		frame.addKeyListener(new KeyController(model));
</code>
</p>
<p>But a Controller does not have to be an explicit listener.
We might, for example,
<a href="MenuController.java">use a MenuBar as a listener</a>,
and connect it with the statement
<code>
		frame.setMenuBar(new MenuController(view,model));	// and controller
</code>
after the instantiation of KeyController in our main program.
It then calls methods on the Model, such as nextPage().
</p>
<p>This also means we can add additional functionality such as loadFile().
And, when we get around to writing the Editing part of this program,
we can add methods like saveFile(), newFile(), etc., to the model, 
and call them from here.
</p>
<p>One complication is that the MenuController needs may need access to the
top-level Frame (just for purposes of Dialog creation), but the View is a
component inside the Frame, and we don't wish to View to know too much
about its environment.
One way around this is to pass the Frame into the MenuController's
Constructor; another is for the View to have a getFrame() method.
</p>
<h2>But Where is Main?</h2>
<p>The Model, View and Controller are usually tied together with a
Main Program; here is part of 
<a href="JPMain.java">JPMain.java</a>.
</p>
<h2>Beyond This</h2>
<p>MVC can be more complex than this.
For an extremely powerful (but wonderful!) example, see the JFC/Swing
components JTable and TableDataModel.
However, this presentation presents the basic idea.
